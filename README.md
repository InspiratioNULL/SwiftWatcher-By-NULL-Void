- **Better Mac Performance:** No dumb helper apps, startup items, or background apps clogging your system. Just one executable doing the job.
- **Transparent Operations:** Want to know what's happening? Just open up the terminal‚Äîno mysterious waiting times or shady background processes.

### Uncompromising Reliability:
- **Control Over Timing:** Specify exactly how long *after* an item *is modified* before taking action‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs **5 seconds**, **5 minutes**, or an epic **669 hours**. You‚Äôre in charge.
- **Data Safety First:** Rest easy knowing your files won‚Äôt be corrupted, moved, copied, or otherwise tampered with until write operations are fully complete.
  
### For The Future:
- **As of right now, Only Apple Silicon is supported, Intel support will be added soon. Updates are going to be added here, star the repo to stay tuned! GUI will be underway, but it will be a separate executable altogether**

### Oh, and Did We Mention?
- **Free as F***:** That‚Äôs right. No ridiculous price tags. Just pure, unfiltered utility.
